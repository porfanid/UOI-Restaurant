# UOI Restaurant

Simple project to view the menu for the restaurant of the university of Ioannina.

## How is it working

It actually reads the page [https://www.uoi.gr/tag/menou-lesxis/](https://www.uoi.gr/tag/menou-lesxis/) which contains all the data for the menu per month. Then it reads the links there and parses the content, keeping all the documents, and finally, it prints the desired document links to the client.

## Where can I find the code running?

The code is running in the school server right here: [https://cse.uoi.gr/~cse74134/restaurant/](https://cse.uoi.gr/~cse74134/restaurant/)

## TODO:
 - Add the posibility to read all the links or just the latest one.
 - Make a function that parses the doc to a json array
